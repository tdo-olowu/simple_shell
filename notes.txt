I think the issue is that I'm getting two processes returned to eval.

Alright now I see another problem.
The damn newline character! After typing the cmd line, there's a newline at the end of the input.
Please get rid of that or the basic commands will never be found.
At the same time, I'm not sure how to make this damn thing fail safely.

So, I've fixed that. The only issue now is dealing with this annoying double free problem,
and the whole parent-child execution part. That has to go smoothly.

I think we should cleanup only when about to leave. In other cases, just keep overwriting the existing memory with each loop.
Now, I have to handle PATH, exit, env, etc.

PATH HANDLING
How should I handle the PATH?
First, getenv(PATH);
Their suggested solution is to convert the PATHS into a linked list, then try each and every directory until the command is found.
Might have to save the command in a separate variable.
